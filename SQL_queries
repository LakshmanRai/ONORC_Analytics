select sum(txn_count) as transactions, salestatename from impds_sep_2023
group by salestatename
order by txn_count desc
limit 1;
```

### 3. Average Transaction Amount

The financial impact of the program is evident, with an average transaction amount of 1429.

```
select round(avg(txn_count)) as transactions from impds_sep_2023;
```

### 4. State-wise Analysis

Further exploring, we identify the average transaction amount for each state, offering insights into regional variations.

```
select avg(txn_count) as transactions, salestatename from impds_sep_2023
